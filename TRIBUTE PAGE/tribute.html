<h2>A brief Biography of Bhagat singh</h2>
<h3>Birth of Bhagat Singh:</h3>
<p>
Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in the village of Banga near Lyallpur district in Punjab, British India. He was an Indian freedom fighter 
who is considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican

<h3><p >Bhagat Singh Thoughts & Opinions: -</p></h3>


<p>
Bhagat Singh’s sense of patriotism had been embedded in him since a very young age. He was raised to value nationalism and yearns for an 
independent India free from British rule. He developed a socialist outlook after reading a lot of European literature and developing a great 
desire for a democratic future for his beloved nation. Bhagat Singh was born a Sikh, but after seeing numerous Hindu-Muslim riots and other 
religious upheavals, he began to lean toward atheism. Bhagat Singh thought that in order to attain something as precious as Independence, 
imperialism’s exploitative aspect needed to be completely eradicated. According to his opinion, only an armed revolution along the lines of the 
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia could bring about such transformation. He coined the phrase “Inquilab Zindabad,” which eventually became the war 
cry of the campaign for Indian independence.

He became the voice of his generation through his criticism of the British Imperial Government in writing and speech. Numerous people 
have questioned his dramatic departure from Gandhi’s non-violent path to Swaraj, yet with his daring embrace of martyrdom, he encouraged 
hundreds of teenagers and young adults to fully engage in the freedom movement. Bhagat Singh won the title of Greatest Indian in 
a 2008 India Today poll, beating out Subhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, demonstrating his standing in modern society.

Singh was re-arrested for murdering Saunders and Chanan Singh based on substantial evidence against him, including statements by his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal.
His life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided.[48] He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail. There 
he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner. He noted that he had received an 
enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a 
hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued that 
they should not be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail.
